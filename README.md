# Needle-in-a-haystack
Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk, but containing one "needle", which you need to find with a for loop.

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says: "Found the needle at position x", with x being the index number at which you find the needle.

So:

var haystack = ['hay', 'rabbit,'needle','hat'];
findNeedle(haystack);

should return:
'Found the needle at position 2'
